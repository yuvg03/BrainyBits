# BrainyBits
BrainyBits is an under-development online non-interactive course website designed to provide a seamless learning experience. Built with a powerful combination of HTML, CSS, and ReactJS, BrainyBits offers a user-friendly interface that allows students to enroll in their desired courses, make payments, and track their learning.

The site is currently under development, and as it is a part of the Object Oriented Software Engineering course, we have also included other non-program documents such as the Initial Requirement Document (IRD) , the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Document and various other diagrams that we created using StarUML namely the Use Case Diagram, The Class Diagram, Sequence Diagrams, Activity diagrams and State Chart Diagrams etc.

# Key Features:

1. **Course Selection**: BrainyBits offers a diverse range of courses from various fields, including technology, science, business, and more. Students can easily browse through all the available courses and select the ones that align with their interests and goals.

2. **Easy Enrollment**: Students can enroll in their chosen courses. BrainyBits's intuitive interface ensures a hassle-free enrollment process, eliminating any complexities that may arise.

3. **Secure Payment Processing**: To promote safe and secure payments, BrainyBits integrates secure payment gateways, ensuring the safety of students' financial information. Users can confidently complete their payments using their preferred method.

4. **Cart Functionality**: BrainyBits allows students to add multiple courses to their cart. This feature simplifies the course selection process, enabling users to explore different options and add them to the cart for later enrollment. Students can conveniently manage their cart, modifying their course choices before proceeding to checkout.

5. **Teacher Dashboard**: BrainyBits provides a dedicated teacher dashboard where instructors can manage their courses. Teachers can effortlessly add new courses, update existing course content, delete courses if required.
