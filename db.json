The most important example of this connection is the use of mole (traditional sauce) for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the South and Central regions of the country.\n\nMexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history. It is created mostly with ingredients native to Mexico, as well as those brought over by the Spanish conquistadors, with some new influences since then. Mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the US-Mexican border. For example, burritos were thought to have been invented for easier transportation of beans by wrapping them in tortillas for field labor.",

Users will also be able to reset their passwords or delete their accounts.\n\nAfter authenticating we will build a \"to-do list\" application that demonstrates how to store data related to the user. This is commonly referred to as authorization. In this app, the user will be able to save tasks for themselves and also view or mark them as complete.\n\nWhile learning authentication we also extend the app so you end up getting experience with a lot of the Firebase services.

What I noticed in people is that they are always interested in how things work, how they really happen on the field. Why, for example there are some photos which are getting more popularity than others. The uniting theme here is composition. Composition is everywhere, it helps you structure one frame, it helps you take advantage of every detail you are surrounded by.\n\nDuring the course, I'll be explaining everything with my own photos. You will see that everything is possible, when you master the language of photography composition, of composition rules.\n\nWe will start with the basics - what BALANCE is, how to achieve it. From there on we'll move to the different composition rules - the Rule of Thirds, the Golden Ratio, the Golden Spiral, till we reach the point where we'll be doing overall composition analysis.\n\nAll of the time we will be analyzing photography - a really valuable skill a few people have. And a few photographers speak about, in fact, especially when it comes to analyzing their own photos.",

In order to survive, technology companies are increasingly depending on continuous delivery to give customers a better experience.

It is much easier to work when all team members can immediately see code changes and can follow what others have done. \n\nIt’s difficult to go wrong with Git. You can always roll back if someone deletes code, changes the structure of your project, or sends out incomplete code. Everyone makes mistakes, but when using Git properly, no mistake is fatal. \n\nToday we will make sure you get familiar, understand, and then master the extremely popular Version Control system called Git. This was originally used in the Linux project, so it is lightweight, but able to cope with the largest of projects.",
